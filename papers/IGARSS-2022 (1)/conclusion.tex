The conducted experiments underline that state-of-the-art UDA methods can be applied in the context of temporal transfer learning for land cover mapping from SITS data. Despite the encouraging results we have obtained, our findings are still preliminary and, therefore, room for improvement still exists. 

%Future works can be devoted to: i) perform extensive experimental evaluations over several benchmarks covering different study areas and ii) design dedicated UDA approaches to cope with the complexity of SITS data in the context of temporal transfer learning.
