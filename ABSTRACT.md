Incomplete time series classification is an important task since real-world temporal data often has missing values.


The increasing accessibility and precision of Earth observation satellite data offers considerable opportunities for industrial and
state actors alike. This calls however for efficient methods able to process time-series on a global scale.

The main purpose of this work is to explore the time series classification methods and to compare the performance of different methods on the same dataset.

Time series have a wide range of applications in fields such as finance, economics, engineering, and natural sciences.
Some common examples of time series data include stock prices, GDP data, climate data, and sales data.
Real world temporal data often has missing values, which makes classification more difficult.
