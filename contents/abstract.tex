    This thesis explores the problem of incomplete time series classification. Time series data, characterized by a sequence of observations taken over time, is abundant in many fields such as finance, healthcare, and satelite observtions. However, missing values in these time series can make the classification task more challenging. The goal of this research is to develop and evaluate methods for classifying time series with missing data. The proposed methods include the use of Random Forests, Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TempCNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to classify time series with missing data. These state-of-the-art machine learning models were implemented and compared in order to determine their effectiveness in handling missing values in time series and improve classification accuracy.
