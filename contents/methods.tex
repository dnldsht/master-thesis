\chapter{Methods}
To initiate the process of identifying the most promising models for time series classification, a comprehensive review of the current state of the art in the field was conducted.
This involved a meticulous exploration of published research studies and academic papers related to the research question.
Subsequently, the different approaches presented in the literature were thoroughly analyzed and compared, following the most promising models were shortlisted for further examination and testing.

Once the model selection phase was completed, I proceeded to conduct an in-depth study of the papers and any available source code.
This was done to enhance their understanding of the underlying algorithms and techniques employed in each model, as well as any implementation details that may be relevant for adapting to the specific research needs.

As a result of these efforts, four models - Random Forest (RF), Adversarial Joint-Learning Recurrent Neural Network (AJ-RNN), Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TempCNN), and Lightweight Temporal Self-Attention Encoder (L-TAE) - were evaluated in this study, and their details are presented in this section.
