\section{Proposed method}
Talk about the goal (compare methods)

How to make fair experiments:\\
  - k-folds different seeds\\
  - same metrics (accuracy)\\
  - organize results (wandb)

Pick models\\
 - read paper\\
 - check for source code\\
 - adapt/update code\\
 -- tensorflow vs pytorch\\
 - experiments\\
 -- hyperparameters\\
 -- architecture\\
