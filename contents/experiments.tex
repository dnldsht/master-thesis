\subsection{Imputation of missing values}

The inclusion of missing data can often be a challenge in machine learning tasks, as missing values can have a significant impact on the performance of the model.
In the first scenario, we addressed this issue by imputing the missing values prior to training the models. 
This allowed us to utilize all available data in the training process, leading to potentially improved performance.

In the second scenario, we did not impute the missing values, which meant that the training process was carried out using only the available non-missing data.
This scenario can be particularly useful in cases where imputation may introduce bias or distort the underlying patterns in the data.

Overall, the results reported in Tables \ref{tab:ALLresultsImputed} and \ref{tab:ALLresultsNoImputed} demonstrate that the inclusion of missing data through imputation did not significantly impact the performance of the models.
