\chapter{Experiments}
In this section, we present an overview of the models and experiments conducted in our study. We evaluated four models: Random Forest (RF), Adversarial Joint-Learning Recurrent Neural Network (AJ-RNN), Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TempCNN), and Lightweight Temporal Self-Attention Encoder (L-TAE).

For each model, we provide a description of its architecture.
We also compare the original authors' findings on hyperparameter configurations with our own observations.
In addition, we discuss any adaptations or modifications made to the original model architecture to better fit our specific problem.

Our experiments were conducted on two datasets: one with pre-imputed missing values and the other without imputation. 
We compare the performance of each model on both datasets and examine any differences in their performance.

\section{Comparing results}

The performance of the different models on both the imputed and non-imputed datasets is compared in this section.

\end{table}

Overall, our experiments show that TempCNN and L-TAE outperformed the other models on both datasets.
Specifically, L-TAE achieved an accuracy of 93.58\% and 93.65\% on the imputed and non-imputed datasets, respectively, 
while TempCNN achieved an accuracy of 93.74\% and 92.57\%. RF and AJ-RNN both achieved lower accuracies. 
These results suggest that deep learning models such as TempCNN and L-TAE may be more suitable for modeling satellite image time series data.

\end{figure}

Based on the confusion matrices, both TempCNN and L-TAE models seem to have difficulty distinguishing between the orchard and crop classes, as indicated by the high number of misclassifications between these two classes.
This could be due to the fact that these two classes may share similar temporal patterns in the time series data, making it more difficult for the models to distinguish between them. 
It may be worth exploring additional features or data sources to improve the performance of the models in distinguishing between these two classes.

\subsection{Imputation of missing values}

The inclusion of missing data is often a challenge in machine learning tasks, as missing values can have a significant impact on the performance of the model.
In the first scenario, we addressed this issue by imputing the missing values prior to training the models. 
This allowed us to utilize all available data in the training process, potentially leading to improved performance.

In the second scenario, we did not impute the missing values, which meant that the training process was performed using only the available non-missing data.
This scenario may be particularly useful in cases where imputation may introduce bias or distort the underlying patterns in the data.

Overall, the results reported in Tables \ref{tab:ALLresultsImputed} and \ref{tab:ALLresultsNoImputed} show that the inclusion of missing data through imputation did not significantly affect the performance of the models.
