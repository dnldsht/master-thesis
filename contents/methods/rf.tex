\section{Random forest}

TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF) \cite{TensorFlow:rf} is the library used to train and evaluate the random forest model.

A Random Forest \cite{breiman2001random} is a collection of deep CART decision trees trained independently and without pruning.
Each tree is trained on a random subset of the original training dataset (sampled with replacement).
The algorithm is unique in that it is robust to overfitting, even in extreme cases e.g. when there are more features than training examples.
It is probably the most well-known of the Decision Forest training algorithms.
